❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Project

This project explores and predicts Heart Disease using real-world medical data. It started with a complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and evolved into an interactive web app built with Streamlit and Machine Learning.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The first part of the project focuses on understanding the dataset and uncovering meaningful relationships between health indicators and heart disease.

🔍 Steps Performed

Data cleaning and overview

Univariate & bivariate analysis

Correlation heatmap and visualizations

Outlier detection

Key insights and conclusions

🧠 Tools Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

💻 Heart Disease Prediction Web App

After completing the EDA, I built a Streamlit web application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on user input such as age, cholesterol, and blood pressure.
